# arvio_emaxx
Home assistant sensor platform for the Avio emaxx

Uses the https://github.com/jamiepenney/arvio_emaxx_reader project to pull data from an Arvio emaxx installation and make it available to Home Assistant

Note: I'm not affiliated with Arvio at all, this is a personal project of mine that I got off the ground by mucking around with the API their device presents.
